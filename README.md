# sql-and-flask
More early Springboard online bootcamp projects, based around SQL databases and, after some basic SQL querying assigments, focusing on use of flask-SQLAlchemy.
They were all done around November/December of 2020. Some are simply SQL files; all full apps include requirements.txt file. 
As with most Springboard projects, they were completed as assignments and generally only meet the specified requirements, thus they may be unpolished and not handle all potential errors.
And yes, I accidentally pushed a bunch of venvs into this repo initially (oops).
